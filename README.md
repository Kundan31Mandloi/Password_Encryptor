# Password_Encryptor
This is helping hand(Header File) for users who want to take password as input in form of symbols (Encrypted Format) as we see on different Platforms(ex Gmail, Fb etc)

Key Features:
1) It takes password of length 8 and we can see the entered password at any Point by pressing Space Key
2) It gives 3 chances to enter correct password else it will lock the file
3) For now, I have used dummy password to check the correctness but we can keep it as per our requirement in File
4) We can use this library in any of the project/file
